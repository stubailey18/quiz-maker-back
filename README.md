# Quiz Maker (Back)

This is the Java (Spring Boot) back-end of an app for building simple multiple-choice-question quizzes. It's a simple REST API that permits CRUD operations for Quiz objects.

You can see the app in action [here](https://stubailey18.com/quiz-maker). The code for the front-end part of the app is accessible [here](https://github.com/stubailey18/quiz-maker-front).
