# Quiz Maker (Back)

This is the Java (Spring) back-end of a little app for building simple multiple-choice question quizzes. It's a simple REST API that permits CRUD operations for Quiz objects. It uses an in-memory database (H2) so the schema is dropped and re-created on startup. I built it so that I could host a working version of the app on Netlify (the back-end is hosted on Heroku).

You can see the app in action [here](https://inspiring-bose-43ed73.netlify.app/).
